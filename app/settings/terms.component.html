2. About Us
KipoTrac is not a marijuana collective or cooperative. It is a service that connects growers, product infused manufacturers, cannabis collectives or cooperatives (collectively, 'Businesses'). It does not offer delivery services, set pricing, or maintain an inventory of legal cannabis to or for Qualified Users or their respective Businesses. We offer you the convenience of receiving information about products from other KipoTrac Users. Through the Site and the App, KipoTrac performs pre-verification checks (that are serviced through METRC and CalCannabis Licensing) on behalf of Proposition 64, but we do not act in any way as a legal marijuana delivery service and so we have no responsibility or liability for any delivery services provided to You. While we make every effort to provide you with information concerning supply chain products, we are under no obligation to update the Information or Content to reflect circumstances that may occur after its initial publication date. Also, we neither endorse nor are responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, content, quality of goods or services offered by KipoNet users and cannot make any representations or warranties with respect to whether the businesses are compliant with applicable rules and regulations. All questions regarding KipoTrac user's products and/or services featured on the Site, the App, and/or the Services should be directed to the appropriate business.
3. Changes in Terms
KipoTrac shall have the right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, to revise these Terms or to impose new terms and conditions with respect to access to or use of the Site, the App, and/or the Services. Such revisions and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any means, including but not limited to, posting the revised or additional terms and conditions on the Site and the App. You are responsible for reviewing the Terms periodically for any modification to these Terms that may affect your rights or obligations hereunder. You agree that you shall be deemed to be apprised of and bound by any modification by KipoTrac to these Terms. ANY ACCESS OR USE OF THE SITE, THE APP, AND/OR THE SERVICES BY YOU AFTER NOTICE OF REVISIONS OR ADDITIONS TO THESE TERMS SHALL CONSTITUTE AND BE DEEMED TO BE YOUR AGREEMENT TO SUCH REVISIONS OR ADDITIONS. No modification to these Terms by any party other than by KipoTrac shall be valid or enforceable against KipoTrac unless expressly agreed to by KipoTrac in a writing signed by a duly authorized officer of KipoTrac.


4. Termination
4.1 These Terms are effective until terminated by KipoTrac. KipoTrac may terminate these Terms without notice and at any time. In the event of termination, you are no longer authorized to access the Site, the App, and/or the Services and the restrictions imposed on you with respect to the Content, the Materials, the disclaimers, indemnities, limitations of liabilities, and the Binding Arbitration Clause (Sections19.2) set forth in these Terms shall survive termination.

You agree to comply with all applicable international laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations regarding your use of the Site, the App, and/or the Service.

6.1 Compliance with Federal Law. You warrant that KipoTrac is only to be used by residents of the State of California and that businesses listed are regulated by the State of California. You also acknowledge that while cannabis has been authorized by the people and legislature of the State of California, the federal government continues to regulate drugs through the Controlled Substances Act ('CSA') (21 USC §811). In Particular, United States federal law considers any use or interstate transportation of marijuana as a criminal offense, which could carry fines and/or subject you to arrest and/or prosecution by federal officials. Accordingly, you acknowledge that neither holding a valid California cultivation marijuana license nor transporting marijuana in interstate commerce is a defense under United States federal law.

6.2 Compliance with California Law. Presently, KipoTrac App, and/or Services are directed to California residents only. If you are not a California resident with a valid marijuana cultivation permit or license, then you cannot register for the Site, the App, and/or the Services. Accordingly, you hereby warrant that you (1) are a California resident that holds a valid marijuana cultivation permit or license; and (2) comply with CDFA’s CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing, and CDPH’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch for cultivators, manufacturers, retailers, distributors, microbusinesses, testing laboratories, event organizers, and codified as Health & Safety Code, § 11362.5 (as well all other County and local state laws related thereto).

Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this 'Dispute Resolution' section will survive any termination of these Terms.

18.3 Arbitration Procedures. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ('AAA') in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the 'AAA Rules') then in effect, except as modified by this 'Dispute Resolution' section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. The arbitration will be conducted by one impartial arbitrator (who may be a former judge, practicing attorney or person who is not an attorney), selected by mutual agreement or, if you and KipoTrac cannot agree, the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.

18.4 Arbitration Process and Applicable Law. Unless you and KipoTrac otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California by one arbitrator. If your claim does not exceed $25,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and KipoTrac submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $25,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. The arbitrator will not award punitive damages to either party and you and KipoTrac will each be deemed to have waived any right to such damages. The arbitrator will, in rending his or her decision, apply the substantive law of the State of California (excluding its choice of law rules that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction). The award of the arbitrator will be rendered within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. It will include a written explanation of his or her decision and specify the basis for any damages, which may include the costs and expenses of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the 'Limitation of Liability' section above (Section 16) as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. The written decision of the arbitrator will be final, binding and non-appealable and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

18.5 Arbitration Fees. Except for the limitations on fees as set forth in Section 19.4 above, your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. If your claim for damages is less than $75,000, however, KipoTrac will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

18.6 Confidentiality. The arbitration proceeding will be confidential. The existence of any matter submitted to arbitration, and the award, will be kept in confidence by you, KipoTrac, and the arbitrator, except as required in connection with the enforcement of such award or as otherwise required by applicable law.

18.7 Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or KipoTrac may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Site, the App, and/or the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

18.8 No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.

18.9 Venue for Other Types of Disputes. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and KipoTrac agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California. Both you and KipoTrac consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
